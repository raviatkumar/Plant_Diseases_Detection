# **Project Title : Plant Diseases Detection using Deep Learning Objective**

### Problem Statement:

To develop a robust deep learning model capable of detecting and classifying plant diseases using image data. The model should be able to accurately identify whether a given plant is healthy or diseased and, if diseased, classify it into one of the specific disease categories. This solution aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early and accurate detection of plant diseases, potentially reducing crop loss and improving yield.

### Dataset Description :

The Plant Diseases dataset contains 2,569 images of 13 different plant species. These images are categorized into 30 different classes, including both healthy and diseased labels. There are a total of 8,851 labeled objects within the dataset.

### Key Characteristics :

Total Images: 2,569

Plant Species: 13

Classes: 30 (including healthy and various diseased categories)

Labeled Objects: 8,851

### Conclusion :

In this project, we successfully developed a deep learning model for detecting and classifying plant diseases using image data. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising 2,569 images from 13 different plant species, categorized into 30 classes, including both healthy and various diseased labels. The key objective was to create a tool that could accurately identify whether a plant is healthy or diseased, and if diseased, correctly classify the type of disease.

Our model demonstrated promising results, providing a robust solution for early and accurate detection of plant diseases. This capability is crucial for farmers and agricultural professionals as it can significantly reduce crop loss and enhance yield by enabling timely intervention.

To further improve the model's accuracy, increasing the number of training epochs can be a beneficial step. More epochs allow the model to learn more effectively from the data, potentially leading to better performance and higher precision in disease classification.

Overall, this project underscores the potential of deep learning in agricultural applications, offering a practical tool for enhancing crop health and productivity through advanced disease detection.
